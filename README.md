- 👋 Hi, I’m @KyraelDev, an Italian student currently exploring Computer Science and Software Engineering in Catania's University, Sicily.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, working and collaborating with fellow developers to build cool products and envision future technologies together, and be part of the change I want to see in the world!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Java and Python. Still learning Vue.Js and React frameworks. I'm interested in learning more exciting tech tools to enhance my workflow and my general knowledge of development.
- 🤖 Currently working as a freelancer AI Trainer for Outlier.AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and connect with fellow Junior Devs or Senior Devs on whichever project will lead me to new and useful knowledge to improve myself!
